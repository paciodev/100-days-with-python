# **100 Days with Python**

## **What's in there?**

It is a repo where I store all of the code from my journey with Python - from beginner to professional

<hr />

## **Folders naming:**

In this repo will be folders with names: `day-number-main-topic`

For example: `day-1-variables`

<hr />

## **Files naming:**

`main.py` - Place for main project after learning for whole day

(if project is bigger it'll be in separate subfolder called `project`)

`notes.py` - Notes from the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code)

_All other files will have comments on the first line describing their purpose of existing in folder_

## **ATTENTION!** All of the projects (not notes) were created by me and only me without seeing solutions, course only provided ideas for projects
